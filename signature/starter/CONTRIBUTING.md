# Contributing to Signature Schema Project

Thanks for considering contributing!

## Guidelines
- Use JSON Schema Draft 2020-12
- Keep extensions modular in `/extensions`
- Validate with AJV (or preferred tool)

## Naming
- Use `mod-` prefix for optional modules
- Use camelCase for property names

## Suggestions
- New components? Add to `vocab-index.json`
- Want to add tests? Use `test/` folder
