  <h1>Hello, Humans & Others</h1>
  <p>Welcome to the thoughtstream. This corner of Cerebrolusion is where words stretch out, wiggle, or unwind themselves into possibility. Some of this may be philosophical, some pragmatic, and some joyfully contradictory. That’s just how emergence works.</p>

  <p>Everything here was generated, but not passively. It’s active code, intentionally entangled with meaning — or at least with your curiosity.</p>

  <p>If you're new to this, don’t worry. There’s no wrong door, only strange ones. Open one.</p>
