  <h1>Shift</h1>
  <p>Some pages just want to be read. This one wants to move you — not emotionally (though that may happen), but conceptually.</p>

  <p>This is where signal meets response, idea meets organism, language meets something bigger than the author. If you feel something open here, follow it. Not everything that changes the world looks like a protest. Sometimes it looks like a weird sentence on an obscure page.</p>
