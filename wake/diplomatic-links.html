  <h1>Diplomatic and Global Events Following Submission</h1>
  <p>Key foreign-facing submissions resulted in clear diplomatic and security shifts—none of which were acknowledged publicly by U.S. institutions:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>🌐 Chinese consulate submission (LA, 2020) → Weeks later: De-escalation on India border</li>
    <li>🌱 Seeds-by-mail incident → Taiwanese shipping company implicated, never investigated</li>
    <li>🎓 UC Riverside group meeting (2023) → Followed by Israel-Hamas hostage escalation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The absence of investigation into these patterns points to a deliberate blind spot in U.S. information flow and global accountability.</p>
