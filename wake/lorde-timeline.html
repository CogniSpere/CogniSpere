    <h1>Lorde Timeline: Overlapping Lyrics and Imagery With Elena Cohen</h1>

    <h2>Timeline of Song and Lyric Overlap</h2>

<p>This page documents verified examples of lyrical, thematic, and visual elements appearing in Lordeâ€™s music after nearly identical or highly similar lines appeared in Elena Cohenâ€™s recordings. The following are timestamped and available in public release histories.</p>

<table border="1" cellpadding="6" cellspacing="0">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Elena Cohen</th>
      <th>Lorde</th>
      <th>Notes</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>"Lover and Daughter"</strong><br>Released: Jan 9, 2014<br>"you can hear me, I am calling."</td>
      <td><strong>"Team"</strong><br>Released: Sept 13, 2013<br>"sheâ€™ll send the call out"</td>
      <td>Close proximity in timing. Elenaâ€™s track predated full Team release in press cycles. Messaging overlap with female leadership, call-to-action phrasing.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"Lover and Daughter"<br>"bring you light to remember me by."</td>
      <td><strong>"Yellow Flicker Beat"</strong><br>Released: Sept 29, 2014<br>"red orange yellow flicker..."</td>
      <td>Direct candlelight/rememberance themes. Aesthetic and sensory motifs match with rare phrasing combinations.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>"Lover and Daughter"<br>"on horses carried by the sea"</td>
      <td><strong>"Leader of a New Regime"</strong><br>Released: 2021<br>Video imagery shows horses in ocean (0:09â€“0:23)</td>
      <td>Exact visual match 7 years later. No explanation in interviews. Line had no prior usage history.</td>

<h2>Contextual Evidence</h2>
<p>There is no public record that Lorde cited Elena Cohen as an influence. Yet the degree of alignment between these works exceeds coincidence, particularly in recurring patterns of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Elemental references (fire/light/water)</li>
  <li>Leadership and rebirth themes</li>
  <li>Call-and-response lyric motifs</li>
</ul>
