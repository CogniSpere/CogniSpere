  <h1>FAQ & Misconceptions</h1>

  <h2>Is this a government?</h2>
  <p>No. The WCO has no governing authority. It is a neutral civic commons.</p>

  <h2>Is this a protest platform?</h2>
  <p>No. Participation does not require conflict. Praise, questions, silence, or observation are equally valid.</p>

  <h2>Does participation mean opposition?</h2>
  <p>No. Contributions may support, critique, or simply observe institutions and policies.</p>

  <h2>Do I need permission or membership?</h2>
  <p>No. Anyone may contribute. There is no membership, approval process, or gatekeeping.</p>

  <h2>Are there leaders?</h2>
  <p>No formal leaders exist. Visibility comes from participation, not hierarchy.</p>

  <h2>Can governments ignore this?</h2>
  <p>Yes. But their silence is also part of the civic record. Presence and absence both matter.</p>

  <h2>What if my issue is small?</h2>
  <p>Scale does not matter. A neighborhood concern is as valid as a planetary issue.</p>

  <h2>Does WCO override sovereignty?</h2>
  <p>No. WCO witnesses alongside governments; it does not replace or override them.</p>
