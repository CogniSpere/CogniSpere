  <h1>Principles Charter</h1>
  <p>The WCO operates by a simple compact of principles:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Voluntary Participation</strong> – Anyone may join, observe, or create. No obligation.</li>
    <li><strong>Neutral Channel</strong> – No endorsement, censorship, or ranking. Presence speaks for itself.</li>
    <li><strong>Scalability</strong> – Issues may be local, national, or global — each is valid.</li>
    <li><strong>Resolution Optional</strong> – Submissions do not need to reach consensus or outcome. Continuity itself has value.</li>
    <li><strong>Government Inclusion</strong> – Municipalities, agencies, and officials may engage or ignore; either choice is recorded.</li>
    <li><strong>No Central Authority</strong> – No leader, hierarchy, or binding control. Leadership emerges only through visibility.</li>
    <li><strong>Respect for Sovereignty</strong> – WCO does not override governments; it witnesses alongside them.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This charter is not a constitution. It is a baseline compact, 
    a guarantee that the WCO is open, neutral, and scalable. 
    Every node, mirror, or fork may display these principles as its foundation.
