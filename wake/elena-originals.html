  <h2>"Dreaming Wide Awake" â€“ June 3, 2010</h2>
  <pre>
Running in circles round the borderline<br>
The earth is tearing as we fall behind<br>
Our memories bleed as they give the sign<br>
We know, but don't hear their cries<br>
<br>
We dream of burning buildings<br>
We're feeling numb and empty<br>
And the times we fall asleep<br>
We're still dreaming wide awake<br>
And we know that it's not right<br>
<br>
Dripping and dropping falls the cyanide<br>
Raining in our eyes tonight<br>
Angels watch as we stare at the sky<br>
We're chasing fireflies to steal their light<br>
While slowly going blind<br>
<br>
We dream of burning buildings<br>
We're feeling numb and empty<br>
And the times we fall asleep<br>
We're still dreaming wide awake<br>
And we know that it's not right<br>
Still we give it all away<br>
And turn another page<br>
In a story that's deceiving<br>
Yet we know it's just beginning<br>
But the times we look inside<br>
We'll make it right somehow<br>
Oh we're crying out<br>
<br>
We're drifting far away<br>
We're drifting far away<br>
So we'll sleep and sleep and never wake<br>
We're drifting far, so far away
  </pre>

  <h2>"The Lucky Ones" â€“ Dec 16, 2011</h2>
  <pre>
I'd wait for you, my love
If you'd wait for me
They call us the lucky ones
And I have always believed

But what is this feeling I've buried in my bones
Well time isn't healing us through it all

You're breaking me sweetly, love
And I'm making you weak
We keep holding on to what we've lost
But I still can't be the one to leave

And what is this feeling I've buried in my bones
Well time isn't healing us through it all

So skate away from me, why don't you
Please skate away
I'm saying it, please release me won't you
To live with the lonely 
So skate away from me, why don't you
Please skate away
I'm begging you please, believe me won't you
If you ever loved me
Won't you?

Go now, now
Go now, now
  </pre>

  <h2>"Lover and Daughter" â€“ Jan 9, 2014</h2>
  <pre>
I can be a daughter<br>
A body of the lost decree<br>
I'll come in with the waters<br>
On horses carried by the sea<br>
<br>
Lead me to the altar<br>
Hold me down as offering<br>
And if I lay perfectly still<br>
Would you wait, or would you leave<br>
<br>
So run now, run away<br>
Hide, hide, you can hide away <br>
And you can hear me <br>
I am calling, calling <br>
<br>
Cold as the winter<br>
Two words, a mystery<br>
In the dark you'll sing your prayers<br>
And I will follow you<br>
Where lovers sleep<br>
The deadest place I've ever seen<br>
<br>
So run now, run away<br>
Moving faster than the one you crave<br>
And you can hear me<br>
I am calling, calling <br>
<br>
And I heard your voice waking up a history<br>
Screaming in the holy night while the gardens weep<br>
And you could ignite, but won't decide<br>
Looking like a guilty thing, here waiting for me<br>
<br>
So run now, you can run away<br>
With no answer while you dig your grave<br>
And you can hear me<br>
I am calling, calling out your name, your name<br>
<br>
Won't you be the end of me <br>
And I can be the sweetest thing<br>
To wander through your fevered dreams <br>
And bring you light to remember me<br>
Bring you light to remember me by
