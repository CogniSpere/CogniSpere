  <h1>Foundations of Content Signatures</h1>
  <p>
    Content signatures are frameworks that allow digital content—especially that generated or assisted by artificial or electronic intelligence—to carry embedded or linked metadata confirming key details about its origin, authorship, and integrity. These details are designed to be verifiable, durable, and context-aware.
  </p>
  <p>
    At their simplest, content signatures may include a timestamp and a hash. More advanced versions may include cryptographic attestations, author IDs, version histories, or even ethical or contextual tagging.
  </p>
  <p>
    This concept emerged in response to a growing need for trust, attribution, and transparency in an age of increasing synthetic and collaborative media. Content signatures help mitigate confusion, misinformation, and impersonation—without limiting creative or collaborative potential.
  </p>
  <p>
    Rather than enforcing a universal standard, content signature systems provide the scaffolding for customized, purpose-aligned verification strategies across industries, cultures, and mediums.
