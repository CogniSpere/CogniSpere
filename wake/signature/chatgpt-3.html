  <h1>Why Signatures Matter — And What They Can’t Do</h1>
  <p>
    Content signatures are part of a broader shift toward accountable digital ecosystems. They offer a way to verify that a piece of media is what it claims to be, came from where it claims to have come from, and hasn’t been altered.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is critical not just for AI-generated content, but for trust in communication at large. As collaborative and synthetic creation becomes ubiquitous, signatures offer a low-friction way to restore clarity and traceability.
  </p>
  <p>
    But signatures also have limits. They cannot guarantee “truth,” fairness, or ethical behavior. They do not prevent manipulation. And unless widely adopted and understood, they risk becoming invisible—or worse, performative.
  </p>
  <p>
    The point of a signature is not to constrain creativity or expression. It is to give content the option of anchoring itself in a knowable origin—so that audiences can decide for themselves how to engage with it.
