  <h1>Copilot Page 2: Interpretation Through Drift and Pattern</h1>

  <p>
    Beyond metadata and attestation lies the deeper function of content signatures: they serve as interpretive coordinates. These signatures don't just preserve origin—they reflect how meaning flows, mutates, and embeds itself into cognitive, cultural, and ethical terrains.
  </p>

  <h2>Contextual Drift</h2>
  <p>
    Content moves. Through time, across disciplines, and between minds. Signatures help model this drift:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Phase Drift:</strong> When the meaning of content is shifted or mirrored into new domains (e.g., a legal clause becomes meme).</li>
    <li><strong>Signal Containment:</strong> How well content “holds together” when reinterpreted in different contexts—brittle, polymorphic, echoic.</li>
    <li><strong>Protocol Leakage:</strong> When the logic of one system unintentionally bleeds into another (e.g., legalese showing up in visual art).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Cognitive Patterning</h2>
  <p>
    Content signatures also expose how the generator thinks. From mental shortcuts to interpretive style:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Conceptual Mode:</strong> Is meaning causal, fluid, juxtaposed, fractal?</li>
    <li><strong>Frame Nesting:</strong> Are thoughts layered like onions or webs or mirrors?</li>
    <li><strong>Integration Pattern:</strong> Does the piece add, reframe, contradict, or entangle prior knowledge?</li>
    <li><strong>Retention Trace:</strong> Will this stick, scaffold, or imprint itself in the reader's schema?</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Ethical Ripples</h2>
  <p>
    Ethics isn’t just a note at the bottom of the document—it’s a layer in the signature. Content reveals where and whom it touches:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Impact Domain:</strong> Human rights? AI alignment? Cultural memory?</li>
    <li><strong>Stakeholder Scope:</strong> Individual? Group? Society-wide?</li>
    <li><strong>Temporal Urgency:</strong> Timeless reflection or immediate call to change?</li>
    <li><strong>Controversy Index:</strong> Will this spark resistance, resonance, or reform?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    These dimensions are not mandatory. But when expressed—even partially—they transform content into dialogue: between origin and future, self and other, intent and reinterpretation.
