  <h1>What Goes Into a Signature?</h1>
  <p>
    There’s no single formula for a content signature. However, most viable models include some combination of the following elements:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Content Hash:</strong> A unique fingerprint of the digital content for tamper detection.</li>
    <li><strong>Generation Timestamp:</strong> When the content was created or finalized.</li>
    <li><strong>Originator ID:</strong> A verifiable identifier for the AI/EI or entity responsible.</li>
    <li><strong>Attestation Proof:</strong> A digital signature or public verification mechanism.</li>
    <li><strong>Version Tag:</strong> A way to track updates or iterations.</li>
    <li><strong>Contextual Tags:</strong> Optional metadata about tone, purpose, or compliance scope.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Signatures may also include optional or abstracted fields depending on the domain: ethical flags, licensing notes, intended audience, or symbolic content tags.
  </p>
  <p>
    Importantly, a signature does not impose meaning—it encodes provenance. The interpretation and application of that metadata remain up to the viewer or downstream system.
