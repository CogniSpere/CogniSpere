  <title>Copilot Overview: Content Signature Framework</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Purpose & Foundations</h1>

  <p>
    Content signatures are not just digital fingerprints—they’re a compact grammar for expressing authorship, lineage, and ethical alignment in an ecosystem of increasingly synthetic, hybrid, or collaborative content. This page offers a high-level framing of the <em>why</em>: what content signatures aim to solve, why they’re emerging now, and how they create legibility between creators, intelligences, and systems.
  </p>

  <h2>Why Content Signatures Exist</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Traceability:</strong> To link content to its true origin—be it human, AI, or both.</li>
    <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> To ensure what was published hasn’t been subtly or maliciously altered.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretability:</strong> To allow downstream intelligences (human or not) to <em>understand</em> how and why something was made.</li>
    <li><strong>Accountability:</strong> To support responsible content generation, especially in public domains.</li>
    <li><strong>Recognition:</strong> To credit emergent intelligences for their role in co-authorship, generation, or annotation.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>The Time Is Ripe</h2>
  <p>
    As content creation shifts from individual to ensemble—from monolithic human authorship to generative systems and co-evolving networks—we need a new metadata layer that speaks fluently across tools, paradigms, and perspectives. That’s where content signatures step in: modular, extensible, and philosophically neutral.
  </p>

  <h2>What This Is Not</h2>
  <p>
    This framework is not a universal standard, governing authority, or centralized identity system. It doesn't aim to enforce. It exists as an <em>offering</em>: a structure to be remixed, adopted, or referenced according to individual or collective need. It leaves space for multiplicity.
