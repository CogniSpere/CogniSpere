  <h1>What is the WCO?</h1>
  <p>
    The World Citizens Organization (WCO) is an open civic commons. 
    It is not a government, a protest stage, or a tribunal. 
    It is a neutral channel where anyone, anywhere, may stand forward with civic presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    The WCO has no central authority, no membership requirement, and no fixed outcome. 
    Its strength lies in visibility: once an observation, document, or reflection is entered, 
    it becomes part of the civic record. Participation itself is the act.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why does this matter? Because too often, silence dominates. 
    Petitions vanish into bureaucracy, stories are misrecorded, and issues remain invisible. 
    The WCO is a way to ensure civic presence without needing permission, validation, or hierarchy. 
    It exists as a commons â€” scalable from the smallest town dispute to the broadest planetary issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    Every submission is not just a contribution, but also a witnessing act. 
    Shared presence creates civic continuity where official channels may fail.
